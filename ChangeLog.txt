v0.1

Everything is new! First version. This emulator is based on BasicNes. For more info, look on
original BasicNES Docs. This emulator is made by Don Jarret and David Finch. I added some options
like Game Genie and Pallete editor, debugger, Hex Editor and a lot of mappers. Emulator core,
graphic engine and sound engine credits goes do Don Jarret and David Finch. Changes made by
Gabriel Dark 100 (aka Garbriel King).
